Automatic Fault Detection in Grid Connected Photovoltaic System using Neural Network 
# Methodology
⚫ We intended to monitor - 
1. Voltage and current of both the strings in the simulation
2. Power
3. Efficiency
4. Temperature 
5. Irradiance

⚫ The proposed MLP-based ANN method only uses available measurements (GCPV currents and voltages), which avoids extra hardware and costs.

⚫ Five different faults can be detected using the fault detection algorithm.

⚫ Multiple faults can be detected in multi strings in the GCPV plant.

⚫ ANN in Google Colab is used for implementing the suggested algorithm.
